\title{Calculates Content Validity Index (CVI) for each item.}
\usage{
calculate_cvi(data = NULL, judge_id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with one row per judge and one column per item. One column must identify the judge.}

\item{judge_id}{A string indicating the column name that identifies each judge.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per item and the following columns:
\describe{
\item{item}{Item name}
\item{n_judges}{Number of judges who rated the item}
\item{n_valid}{Number of judges who rated the item as valid (3 or 4)}
\item{cvi}{Content Validity Index: \code{n_valid / n_judges}}
\item{min_acceptable}{Minimum acceptable CVI threshold for that number of judges}
\item{acceptable}{Logical value indicating whether the item meets the acceptable threshold}
}
}
\description{
This function computes the Content Validity Index (CVI) for a set of items rated by multiple judges.
It recodes item ratings such that scores of 1 and 2 are considered not valid (0),
and scores of 3 and 4 are considered valid (1). Then, it calculates the proportion
of valid ratings (1) out of total non-missing ratings per item.
}
\details{
Additionally, it evaluates whether each item's CVI is acceptable based on the number of judges,
following common recommendations in the literature:
\itemize{
\item 2 judges: CVI must be 1
\item 3–5 judges: CVI ≥ 0.83
\item 6–8 judges: CVI ≥ 0.83
\item 9 or more judges: CVI ≥ 0.78
}
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(
  judge = c("A", "B", "C"),
  item1 = c(4, 3, 2),
  item2 = c(1, 4, NA),
  item3 = c(3, 2, 3)
)
calculate_cvi(data = df, judge_id = "judge")
}
